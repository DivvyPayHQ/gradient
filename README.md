# GradualizerEx

Adapts Gradualizer to work with the Elixir applications. This package is focused on presenting errors generated by Gradualizer in Elixir syntax.

Also delivers a mix task that runs the Gradualizer on the Elixir project:
> mix gradualizer

## Problem with abstract code genereted from Elixir

The Elixir AST stores literals as themselves. Thus the abstract code generated from Elixir doesn't have information about the line of the literals. This lack of information makes it hard to localize the error in a code because the line is set to 0.

To overcome this problem GradualizerEx reads the abstract code from beam files, then traverses it and fills the missing lines. The lines are taken from the corresponding token or from the parent form.

### Mix task
---
For now, this task localizes all project beams and runs GradualizerEx on each file. What's more, it tries to import all dependencies to Gradualizer.

##### TODO
- Support options,
- Support umbrella project,
- Ensure that deps are imported correctly to the Gradualizer.

### Printing errors
The type errors are highlighted in the Elixir code. Erlang preaty printers are still used in the error descriptions.


##### TODO
- Implement expr preaty printer for Elixir expr,
- Implement type preaty printer for Elixir.

### Specyfing lines in expressions


##### TODO
